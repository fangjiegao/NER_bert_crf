class PaddingInputExample(object):
    """
    Fake example so the num input examples is a multiple of the batch size.

    When running eval/predict on the TPU, we need to pad the number of examples
    to be a multiple of the batch size, because the TPU requires a fixed batch
    size. The alternative is to drop the last batch, which is bad because it means
    the entire output data won't be generated.

    We use this class instead of `None` because treating `None` as padding
    battches could cause silent errors.
